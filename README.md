"You should have a record!"

That's how this works.
If there was something in [a person's] past that could explain or show that [they were] a bad kid, that [they] had a record; that [they'd] been in trouble before, then [the police] could win the argument.
[...] Being able to characterize someone, to essentialize who they are, because of some prior encounter with law enforcement -- no matter their guilt or innocence -- [is] a fundamental ingredient to the process of punishment in the country.

[Paraphrased] from Khalil Gigbran Muhammad, author of "The condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America."
Quoted from Throughline. "American Police" Podcast, Jun 03 2020.
